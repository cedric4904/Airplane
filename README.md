# US Airline customer segmetation

The data was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndddddd/customer-satisfaction
I have performed PCA and Clustering analysis on this dataset to segment customers into 2 different groups, based on what they sastified about US Airline' service. After that, the groups were put into descriptive analysis to find out more about their characteristics. Hence, I came into conclusion on what US airways needs to improved and solutions for each group.
